# Analysing Energy Data of Countries
Three datasets have been used (they can be found in assets folder):-<br>
1) [Energy supply and renewable electricity production](https://aexruozh.labs.coursera.org/notebooks/assignments/assignment3/assets/Energy%20Indicators.xls)
2) [Sciamgo Journal and Country Rank data for Energy Engineering and Power Technology](http://www.scimagojr.com/countryrank.php?category=2102)
3) [Countries' GDP from 1960 to 2015 from World Bank](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD)<br>
The above three datasets are merged and are anlysed to find correlation between many parameters using Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Persons' Correlation.
